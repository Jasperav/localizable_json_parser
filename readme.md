# Parse Localizable.xcstrings
This small library can parse Localizable.xcstrings in JSON format. Call either one of the 3 public parse functions to get back a `Localizable` struct back.
With the `Localizable` struct you can write Android message resource files automatically. This is useful when you want to share message resource between apple and android apps.
